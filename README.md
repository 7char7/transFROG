help im trapped

making games with gml is cinceptually quite simple;
1. Create immage assets (sprites, tilesets, fonts), & add them to asset broswer (window on left)
2. Create object asset to respresent things you want to use in your game, and assign the object an image asset (sprite) (objects make game run, run most code here)
3. Program these objects to do things in response to specific events
4. add instances of these objects into a "room" where they will preform their programs (this "room" view is what your game will look like)
